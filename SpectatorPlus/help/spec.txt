§6§lThis command is the base command of SpectatorPlus.
§rUse it to enable or disable spectate mode for players, create arenas, change the configuration, etc.
on:Enables spectator mode for the given player (or yourself).
off:Disables spectator mode for the given player (or yourself).
say:Broadcasts a message to the spectator chat.
togglehide:Hides a player from spectators, even if the mode allows them to be seen (players with sufficient permission can still see them).
list:Lists all players currently spectating.
mode:Changes which players are shown to spectators in the teleporter, based on the location of both.
arena:Manages arena creation, deletion, listing, lobby management, etc.
lobby:Sets or deletes the global spectator lobby, where players are teleported when they enter or leave spectator mode (if this is set).
config:Updates the plugin configuration from ingame, with instant application of the new settings.
b:A workaround command to exit the no-clip mode, because some versions of CraftBukkit 1.8 don't register inventory clicks for players in vanilla spectate gamemode.
help:Displays this help.
