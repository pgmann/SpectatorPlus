Hides a player from spectators.

This command allows you to hide a player from the
spectator GUI, even if the mode allows them to be seen
ยง7(see /spec help mode)ยงr.

Running the command on a player who was previously
hidden will make them visible again.

Spectators with the permission spectate.admin.hide.see
(by default, operators) will still be able to see hidden
players. Hidden players will be prefixed with a HIDDEN tag
in the teleportation GUI.
