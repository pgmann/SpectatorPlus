Manages arenas.

This command provides options to create, update,
delete and list arenas.
It is only useful if the spectating mode is set
to ARENA §7(see /spec help mode)§r.

An arena is a 3D, box-shaped region in the game;
while spectating, a player has to select an arena
using the arena selector (next to their teleporter)
and, when selected, their teleporter only displays
players within that arena's bounds.

An arena can have a lobby, were spectators are
teleported when they select the arena.

To create an arena, use §6/spec arena add§r. You
can either specify bounds coordinates directly, or
create the arena in a WorldEdit-like manner, by
punching the corners, if you execute only §6/spec
§6arena add <name>§r without coordinates.

Use the other commands (see above) to set the lobby
or delete an arena.
