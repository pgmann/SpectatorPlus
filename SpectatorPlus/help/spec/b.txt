Disables the no-clip mode.

This command can only be used if you are currently
spectating and if the forced vanilla spectator mode
is not enabled.

It is here to be used as a workaround for a CraftBukkit/
Spigot bug: in some earlier versions (1.8.0), it was not
possible to detect when a player clicked on their inventory,
if they were in vanilla spectator mode. This is no longer the
case in recent CraftBukkit/Spigot versions, so you can ignore
this command and use the GUI instead.

Unless you really want to use this, of course!
