Displays or updates the configuration instantly.

If used without a new value (/spec config <path>),
the current configuration value is displayed. 
Including a new value after the <path> updates
the configuration entry directly from the game.

The updates are instantaneously applied. For example, try
changing the item representing the teleporter. All spectators
will instantly see the item change in their inventory.
You can also try disabling the spectators tools - the tools GUI
will force-close if it's open and the tool will disappear.

§oThis is basically an interface to the config.yml file.
§oPlease note that some values cannot be updated, like
§othe lists.
